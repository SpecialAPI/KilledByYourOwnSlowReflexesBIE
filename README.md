# Killed By Your Own Slow Reflexes
Do you think that deaths in Enter the Gungeon aren't humiliating enough? Do you want to have the resourceful rat drawings present at all times for some reason? Do you want the game to literally tell you that you have a skill issue every time you die?
## Well then this mod is for you!
This mod changes the death label in the death screen to say "Killed by: Your own slow reflexes".

# Skill Issue Mode
In the config file for this mod, you can set the `SkillIssueMode` value to true to make the death label say "A skill issue"

There's also `RatDrawingMode` which makes the death screen always display the rat drawings.
